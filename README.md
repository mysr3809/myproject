# TRAVELLER

This project shows the information of the countries to be visited. It also contains up-to-date information as a recommendation. Sometimes people may want to visit lesser-known and unexplored countries instead of the famous ones. Before traveling to these countries, you can find the necessary warnings, precautions and information on the site I created.

Different technologies have been used in the creation of this site. ReactJs is used as the main.
The user can actively search for countries and add them to favourites. In addition, APIs from different sources have been used and various information has been transferred to the user.
The user can also see some photos from the country they want to travel to.
